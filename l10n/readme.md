# 🔤 Localization

This directory contains the file [l10n.js](l10n.js) for localizing error pages. Once the error page is loaded,
this script runs and translates the page content to the user's locale.

> [!NOTE]
> In version `2.*`, the working logic was simpler: error pages loaded this script using
> [jsdelivr.com](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) as a CDN for
> [versioned content from the GitHub repository](https://www.jsdelivr.com/features#gh), and it translated
> tag content with the special HTML attribute `data-l10n`.

By default, the error page markup contains strings in English (`en` locale). To localize the error pages to
different locales, please follow these steps:

1. Find your locale name on [this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) (column `Set 1` or `ISO 639-1:2002`)
2. Fork this repository
3. Edit the file [l10n.js](l10n.js) in the `data` map (append new localized strings) using the locale name from step 1
4. Please add your locale to the [playground.html](playground.html) file to test the localization
5. Make a PR with your changes
